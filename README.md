This is very simple project demonstrating how to use cucumber and how it provides more readable and modular code.

Here I have implemented simple Calculator class, which performs basic operations such as addition, subtraction, 
multiplication and division. Now to test this application for letâ€™s say, n different data sets, we need to write 
4*n test cases. But using cucumber, we write only four test cases, one for each operation , then for any number of data 
set we only add different scenarios (see calcu.feature, You need to run this file to see output.)

Cucumber is used to bridge the gap between software developers and non-technical stakeholders.
