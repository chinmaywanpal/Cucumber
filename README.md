This is very simple project demonstrating how to use cucumber and how it provides more readable and modular code

Here I have implemented simple Calculator class, which performs basic operations such as addition, subtraction, 
multiplication and division. Now to test this application for letâ€™s say, five different data sets we need to right 
20 test cases. But using cucumber, we write only four test cases, one for each operation , then for any number of data 
set we only add different scenarios (see calcu.feature)
