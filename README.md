This is very simple project demonstrating how to use cucumber and how it provides more readable and modular code.

Here I have implemented simple Calculator class, which performs basic operations such as addition, subtraction, 
multiplication and division. Now to test this application for letâ€™s say, five different data sets, we need to write 
20 test cases. But using cucumber, we write only four test cases, one for each operation , then for any number of data 
set we only add different scenarios (see calcu.feature)

Cucumber is used to bridge the gap between software developers and non-technical stakeholders.
